# Cachify - Redis-like In-Memory Key-Value Store

Cachify is a lightweight, Redis-inspired in-memory key-value store built in C/C++ with:
- Multithreaded access to support concurrent clients  
- TCP client–server communication  
- TTL-based key expiration  
- Redis-like command protocol  

This project simulates the behavior of a distributed cache system with clean, simple operations.
